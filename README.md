Introduction to the NAS File Viewer

It is a NAS file viewer developed based on web technologies. The entire application is built using pure front - end technologies, namely HTML, CSS, and JS.


This viewer supports the quick viewing of files and allows users to download files. However, it should be noted that there are currently some bugs in the download functionality.


Regarding file operations, this software does not support file modification, deletion, or upload at present.


In terms of system compatibility, this software is designed to run on Linux systems. Although it can also run on Windows systems, the compatibility is not very good.
